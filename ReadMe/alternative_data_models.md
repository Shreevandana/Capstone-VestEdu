# Alternative Dataset Model Development 
For Linear regression model and Random forest regression

R file to predict the Cohort Default Rates (2yr and 3yr estimates) for synthetic dataset.
Dataset is present in ../Data/AlternateMethod-DOEMergedDataForModels-v1.2.xlsx


## Usage
Requires R Console or R-Studio to run this R-Script. 
Also requires the dataset to be present in the same working directory as the codes

This R file is used to build the models (Linear regression and random forest regression models)
with dependent variable as CDR2 or CDR3 
and independent variables as University Rank + Major + Degree 

CDR2/3 ~ Rank + Major + Degree

## Sample Output 
For sample output of the codes please refer to the alt_data_models.html file included in the Readme directory.

## Reference
This script was  created as a part of the project in the Capstone class (DSC 483, http://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/news/2018/2018-0613-capstones.html) at the University of Rochester, New York.
